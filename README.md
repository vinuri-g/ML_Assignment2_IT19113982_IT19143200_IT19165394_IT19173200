# Predicting Cholesterol Risk Level Using Machine Learning

Cholesterol is a type of fat which moves through our body through blood. Cholesterol is made from our body as well as contained in the food we take in. Cholesterol is important to make layers inside blood vessels which act as a gatekeeper for things to move in and out of body cells. But there is a certain level of cholesterol that is needed for this. That is why it is important for oneâ€™s health to maintain the level of cholesterol needed without letting it go below or above the required range. Using attributes such as age, gender, height, weight, smoking habits and calorie level, we can, predict the cholesterol risk of a person.
